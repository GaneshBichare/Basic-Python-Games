# Fibonacci Series and Cube Calculator

## Welcome
Welcome to the Fibonacci_Series project! This simple Python script generates the Fibonacci series and calculates the cubes of numbers in reverse order.

## Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter a number to generate the Fibonacci series up to that number.
3. Explore the beauty of Fibonacci numbers!

## Cubes
This part of the script calculates and prints the cubes of numbers in reverse order.

### Usage
1. After generating the Fibonacci series, the script prompts you to enter another number.
2. Enter a number, and the script will calculate and display the cubes of numbers in reverse order.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fibonacci_Series.git
###Sample Output 

Here's an example of what you might see when running the script:
